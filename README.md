# simple\_vcpkg\_library\_application

## Purpose

This repository, along with [simple_vcpkg_library](https://github.com/drescherjm/simple_vcpkg_library), provides a minimal C++ library example that demonstrates how to make your own libraries consumable via vcpkg in manifest mode.

The test application in this repository automatically downloads, compiles, and links against *simple_vcpkg_library* using vcpkg's manifest workflow.
